# Black Knight Game
The game was developed using JavaFX.

You can play the game as human or using one of the following algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*, HillClimbing).

The algorithms will give you the solution and the path they have got to reach the goal. 

For more information about the algorithms you can see:
- Depth First Search ([DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)).
- Breadth First Search ([BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)).
- Uniform Cost Search ([UCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)), its known as dijkstra algorithm.
- A Star ([A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)).
- Hill Climbing ([Hill Climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)).
